Self-Assessment - Software Engineer 2024

Achievements and Key Contributions
Project Management and Execution

Successfully led a project focused on updating holiday files, adding new watch files, and maintaining record logs. This involved collaboration with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth and timely execution, meeting all project deadlines with minimal errors.
Connectivity and Integration Testing

Conducted comprehensive SFTP connectivity tests between SG PBCCL and RMD, as well as between PBCCL and the AIP server. I ensured secure data transfers, optimized configurations, and resolved connectivity issues, which improved operational efficiency and reliability in data exchange processes.
System Upgrades and Maintenance

Played a key role in ITSO tasks, including studying and upgrading the CDGateway to enhance system performance. This involved researching best practices, testing various configurations, and implementing improvements that contributed to a more resilient system.
Performance Tuning and Optimization

Engaged in PBCCL performance tuning tasks to identify bottlenecks and optimize the system’s performance. This effort led to measurable improvements in processing times and reduced latency, resulting in a more responsive and efficient platform.
SA Moderation Project and Legacy Task Management

In the SA Moderation project, successfully executed a planned shutdown of the ESA legacy WebSphere Application Server (WAS) over a structured four-day process. This required meticulous preparation of a clear runbook, involving multiple teams to ensure all dependencies and risks were managed. Through effective collaboration and communication, the shutdown was completed successfully, marking the decommissioning of this legacy service.
Additionally, resolved memory issues in the CSV generation process, optimizing data handling and memory management, which reduced memory consumption and improved stability during large data exports.
Implemented different scheduled jobs in the SA Moderation project to migrate old jobs to the new Sparter system, successfully coordinating the transition. This involved analyzing scheduling requirements, setting up various schedules, and ensuring all legacy jobs were seamlessly integrated into Sparter. The migration improved system efficiency and reduced the maintenance burden on legacy systems.
SAM EFM F24 Testing

Contributed to the SAM EFM F24 testing project by collaborating with multiple teams to address a critical MQ (Message Queue) configuration issue in the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment. This involved troubleshooting configuration settings, coordinating with stakeholders across different teams, and implementing adjustments that resolved connectivity issues. This effort ensured a smooth testing process and set a solid foundation for the system’s stability in production.
Skill Development and Learning
AWS

Dedicated time to learning AWS, focusing on core services such as EC2, S3, and Lambda. Gained foundational knowledge in cloud infrastructure and deployment, which I applied to improve scalability and efficiency in several projects. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my knowledge of cloud-native application development.
React

Enhanced my front-end development skills by learning React. I worked on small projects to familiarize myself with component-based architecture and state management, which improved my ability to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces. In future projects, I plan to integrate React into my development workflow more extensively.
Spring Boot

Studied Spring Boot to strengthen my backend development skills, particularly for building scalable microservices. I completed tutorials on creating RESTful APIs and integrated them with existing projects, which allowed me to enhance system modularity and maintainability.
Goals for 2025
Deepen Expertise in Cloud Computing (AWS)
Continue to expand my knowledge of AWS, with a focus on advanced services and security best practices to further support cloud infrastructure initiatives within the team.

Advanced Front-End and Back-End Integration
Work on projects that integrate React with Spring Boot to build full-stack applications, leveraging my skills to create end-to-end solutions that meet both business and user needs.

Performance Optimization and System Reliability
Apply learnings from past performance tuning tasks to proactively optimize new projects. Aim to implement monitoring and alerting systems to ensure high reliability and fast response times across all services.

Conclusion
In 2024, I made significant progress in both project execution and skill development, particularly in cloud computing, front-end, and back-end technologies. My work on shutting down the ESA legacy WebSphere Application Server, migrating legacy jobs to the Sparter system with varied scheduling needs, and resolving MQ configuration issues in the SAM EFM F24 testing project showcased my project management, technical, and collaborative skills. I also tackled technical challenges like resolving CSV generation memory issues, enhancing system efficiency. Moving forward, I am committed to advancing my technical capabilities and contributing to impactful projects that align with our team’s goals. I look forward to utilizing my enhanced skill set to take on more complex challenges and drive continuous improvement in our systems and processes.
